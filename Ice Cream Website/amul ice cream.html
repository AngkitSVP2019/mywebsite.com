	<p class="para1">Amul Ice Cream was launched on 10th March, 1996 in Gujarat. The portfolio consisted of impulse products like sticks, cones, cups as well as take home packs and institutional/catering packs. Amul ice cream was launched on the platform of ‘Real Milk, Real Ice Cream’ given that it is a milk company and the wholesomeness of its products gives it a competitive advantage.</p>

	<p class="para2">In 1997, Amul ice creams entered Mumbai, Chennai in 1998 and Kolkata and Delhi in 2002. Nationally it was rolled out across the country in 1999.</p>

	<p class="para3">It has combated competition like Kwality Walls, Mother Dairy and achieved the No.1 position in the country. This position was achieved in 2001 and it has continued to remain at the top.</p>
