		<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<div class="history">
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>Wall's was founded in 1786 by Richard Wall, when he opened a butcher's stall in St. James's Market, London. In the 1900s, the business was led by Richard's grandson Thomas Wall II. Every year, the company had to lay off staff in the summer as demand for its sausages, pies and meat fell, so in 1913 Thomas Wall II conceived the idea of making ice cream in the summer to avoid those lay-offs; the First World War meant that his idea was not implemented until 1922. Following his retirement in 1920, Thomas Wall II created his Trust for the “encouragement and assistance of educational work and social service”. Today, the Trust continues to assist in these areas by providing grants to individuals and organisations.</p>

		<h2>Ice Cream begins</h2>
		<p>Unilever continues to use the brand for ice cream in the UK and it has become part of the company's international Heartbrand strategy, where it retains its local ice cream brand but shares one logo and most of the product's lineup with the various other Heartbrand brands across the world. While in 2006, the market leader in the UK for individual hand-held products such as Cornetto and Magnum, and value-added multi-portion products designed to be eaten at home, such as Viennetta, the Wall's brand faces severe competition from the major supermarket brands and to a lesser extent from Nestlé and Mars spin-off ice cream products.</p>
