	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>Baskin-Robbins was founded in 1945 by Jewish brothers-in-law Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins from the combining of their respective ice cream parlors, in Glendale, California. The Baskin-Robbins ice cream parlors started as separate ventures of Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins, who owned Burton's Ice Cream Shop and Snowbird Ice Cream. Snowbird Ice Cream offered 21 flavors, a novel concept at that time. When the separate companies merged in 1948, the number of flavors was expanded to 31 flavors. By 1948, Burt and Irv had opened six stores. The first authorization covering the sale of ice cream was executed May 20, 1948, for the first store in 1130 South Adams in Glendale. In 1949, the company's production facility opened in Burbank. Burt and Irv made the decision to sell the stores to the managers. In 1953, Baskin-Robbins hired Carson-Roberts Advertising who recommended adoption of the number 31 as well as the pink (cherry) and brown (chocolate) polka dots and typeface that were suggestions of the circus. The first store that adopted the new 31 look was 804 North Glendale Ave in Glendale, California, in March 1953.</p>
